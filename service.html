  <h2><strong>Service</strong></h2>
  <p><strong>Church</strong></p>
  <p>I have been an active member of my church in a variety of ways. I was a  
  <br>Sunday School teacher for students during the pandemic, doing what I could
  <br>to keep the children engaged with their faith during a difficult time. 
  <br>I have also been volunteering in our annual Vacation Bible School for the 
  <br>past seven years in any way I can, whether it is helping with decorations 
  <br>or as an assistant teacher.</p>

  <p><strong>Big Event</strong></p>
  <p>I had the privilege to be part of The Big Event in Galveston, a time where 
  <br>Texas A&M students give back to the community as a way for thanking them 
  <br>for everything they have done. My group was in charge of renovating an 
  <br>elementary school garden by painting pots, creating sieves, and planting flowers.
  <br>It was a long process, but we could tell the school staff were overjoyed at
  <br>the new life we put into their school.</p>

  <p><strong>Singing Cadets</strong></p>
  <p>I am an active member of the Texas A&M Singing Cadets and am currently in 
  <br>my second year with the organization. We are a mens choral organization
  <br>whose main purpose is to enhance the public relations of Texas A&M
  <br>University through musical presentations, as well as to develop 
  <br>disciplined leaders of character. We perform over 70 concerts all over the
  <br>state of Texas, as well as go on national and international tours every year.
  <br>Within the group, I am part of the Academic Committee, striving to promote
  <br>healthy learning habits for freshmen. I also helped organize the 130th 
  <br>Anniversary for the group, where we had to contact past members, as well
  <br>as set up the venue for the after party. Additionally, I was a part of the
  <br>Banquet Committee, making sure the venue was prepared and everyone went smoothly
  <br>during the annual Singing Cadets Spring Banquet.

  <p><strong>Future Projects</strong></p>
  <p>This year, I am hoping to start a club where students come together to donate 
  <br>food to food pantries either near or on campus. Hopefully, this will become 
  <br>something many students can contribute to in the future to help those who 
  <br>struggle to bring food to the table.</p>
